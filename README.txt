For the project work you will need to insert the Database file in your IDE (Visual Studio 2017) at my case.
And go to the Server Explorer 
then right click on Data Connections
and Add data connection
then Set the Data Source to: Microsoft SQL Server Database File (SqlClient)
and set the Log on to server by: Use Windows Authentication
after that click OK
and you good to go.
